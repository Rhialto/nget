.SH NAME
nget \- retrieve files from NNTP hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nget [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nget
retrieves messages matching a regular expression, and decodes any files
contained within.  Multipart messages are automatically pieced together.
.SH EXAMPLES
get listing of all files matching penguin*.png from alt.binaries.pictures.linux:
.br
.B nget -g alt.binaries.pictures.linux -R "penguin.*png"
.P
retrieve all the ones that have more than 50 lines:
.br
.B nget -g alt.binaries.pictures.linux -l 50 -r "penguin.*png"

.SH BUGS
In multi part messages, part 0/x is usually a description.. this will be saved.
But sometimes the description will be in 1/x, in which case it is not saved.
This would either need modification of libuu, or some ugly hacks.  I'll look
into it in a later version.
.P
This man page doesn't list many of the options, see
.B nget --help
for the full list.
