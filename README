nget 0.4  Copyright 1999 Matt Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>

Install:
0) if you have uulib as a shared lib: ./configure and skip to step 2
1) d/l uulibsrc from http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~fp/uudeview 
1.1) unpack it and run its ./configure && make
1.2) ./configure --with-uulib=/dir/that/has/uulib
1.2a) depending upon your compiler you may need to do something like:
  CXXFLAGS="-fhandle-exceptions -O2" ./configure ....
1.2b) if you get strange errors about redo(and other vars) possibly being used
  uninitialized try compiling with a lower optimization (seen on a freebsd sys,
  with gcc 2.7.2.1)
2) make 
3) make install

nget is developed on linux (glibc2), and compiles without modifications on
freebsd 2.2.8(did need the CXXFLAGS env to be set as outlined above though, if
someone has an autoconf test for wether a flag is needed to enable exceptions,
I'd appreciate it).  It should probably work on other systems with little or no
modifications.
