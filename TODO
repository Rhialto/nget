 * allow user to place a .password or something in their respective cache dir,
	so they don't have to put it on the command line.
 * better fix for buildflist's making a regex outta local filenames that have
 	special chars in them.
 * check for existance of files, don't d/l what we have already (overridable?)
	use substring match to select filename? (ie: -r "heres the
	files:.*(snarf\.r..) ").
	or try some sort of parsing?  prolly really hard to get right for all
	(even most) cases possibly could do a glob, then search through the
	headers with the file names.. come at the problem from reverse - done
	the reverse way.. seems pretty successful, though it doesn't stop from
	d/l'ing multiples of the same file.. could be adapted to such though,
	by adding files to a similar list after they are d/l'd and we know
	their names.
 * possibly store wether the article has been read within the header cache, for
	easier and faster checks.
 * allow searching based upon date/author/lines etc.  ideally, something like:
   nget -r (date > 03/04/1999 && (author = bob && subject = file\.) || (subject
   = blah))
