nget (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed command line arg problems when built with getopt rather that libpopt.
  * fixed creating _midinfo files with no permissions problem (caused error
    after trying to use the group for the second time on some systems).
  * fixed implicit declaration of function close() in mylockfile.h on some
    systems.
  * fixed multiple uses of -p being relative to each other rather than the
    start directory.
  * added curservmult config option (was hardcoded to 2.0 in v0.8)
  * fixed a few documentation ommisions

nget (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * nget version 0.8 released on 2000-04-12. (sorry about that wait.)
  * fullxover server option to try to fill in gaps in header lists, for servers
    that don't always add headers in order.
  * Now compiles under cygwin. (Though due to ommisions in the exports for the
    cygwin library, it needs the files in glob/, and you will need to d/l
    libpcre (or perhaps another regex library..), and probably libpopt) 
  * Added -N to allow decoding of parts gotten with -K or -w/ngetlite without
    connecting to server for unretrieved parts.
  * Changed -d operation to support dupechecking in any combination of existing
    files and parts already downloaded.
  * Added -w to write a list of parts to then be gotten with ngetlite.
  * Added ngetlite program for use on comps with older compilers and/or less
    memory. (Still requires you write a list of parts to get with nget -w)
  * Added -P to use a different directory for temp files.
  * Added -L/-S to support filesystems that can't handle the longer tempfile
    names.
  * Fixed bug that occasionaly caused a file to be corrupted (split line).
  * Now uses ~/.nget3 directory, since config/cache formats have changed.
  * Improved multi-server support that can piece together seperate parts from
    multiple servers.
  * Added -k and -K to keep temp files around or not decode at all.
  * Added -R to retrieve based upon any number of rules.
  * Added libpopt support.
  * Added -@ option to read commands from a file (only available with libpopt,
    getopt is not reentrant)
  * Added -s option to specify retry delay.
  * Now aborts on invalid regex entry, instead of segfaulting.
  * Added ability to specify a port in the standard host:port method. (reminded
    by Pete Bentley)
  * Xover consistancy check now allows extra whitespace in numeric fields (Pete
    Bentley) (actually, it allows whitespace anywhere in the field.. could
	probably be improved to only allow it at the end (maybe at the beginning?)
	but I'm not gonna go to that much trouble.)
  * Fixed complete bombing out on bad xover, instead of skipping the header
    like it should have. (reported by Pete Bentley)
  * Fixed a bug that would occasionally split parts from one multipart posting
    into two seperate groups.

nget (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stores file read info in a seperate file, so it does not need to resave the
    cache if the only change was to mark some messages read.
  * Added +uulib version of the source distro, for easier compilation.
  * Now recognizes when there is no disk space left, and aborts.  fwrite()
    doesn't seem to report errors correctly, at least on linux glibc2.  man
    fwrite says "If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return
    value is a short item count (or zero)."  However fwrite() would _always_
    return the full item count, even if the disk was full.  I guess this is a
    libc bug. (fyi, this is on glibc 2.0.7).  It now uses write(), which does
    handle errors correctly.  
  * Added consistancy checking on header retrieval. (Steven Wilcoxon) 
  * Manpage now contains all info that it should.  
  * Fixed dupe filename checking. (broke in 0.5)
  * Only creates a host cache directory if there is something to be written in
    it.
  * Added .ngetrc, with default options, and host/group aliases.
  * Added check for -luulib in configure.in, seems some distro's have it
    installed as such, instead of -luu.

nget (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "file read" flag to stop redundant downloading.
  * Watches for a downloaded multipart file being exactly the same as what
    already exists.  Can be disabled with --disable-filecompare. (Steven Wilcoxon)
  * Rewrote header cache code, should now use as little as 1/4th the memory
    depending upon how many multipart messages there are.  Actual disk space
    saved is less due to zlib compression, but it shouldn't be near as much of
    a memory hog when running now.  If you are upgrading from a previous
    version, you will need to reget all your headers.
  * Reads .authinfo in cache dir so you don't have to put it on the command
    line.
  * Optional use of checksum in the filename, rather than
    host/group/articlenum/etc which takes up a rather large amount of space.
    Added advantage is that since the filename is now based soley on the group
    and the subject/author headers, it should be entirely possible to download
    part of a multipart file from one server and the rest from another!
  * Implemented use of crc32 checksums to compare headers when piecing together
    multipart messages, maybe save a bit of cpu power.

nget (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * a bit of fixes to the error recovery stuff.
  * handles local files with regex special chars (somewhat) better
  * nntp authinfo user/pass authorization supported
  * trying to retrieve a no longer available article will merely skip to the
    next file, rather than aborting.
  * now compiles on linux libc5

nget (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * included aclocal.m4 in the tar.gz

 -- Matt Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>  Tue, 15 Jun 1999 20:59:54 -0700

nget (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doesn't download files you already have.. kinda rudementary, could easily
    cause problems if you have a file like "a" in the dir..
  * c_file now has buffered gets() capability, which not only is far faster
    than gzgets(), it is even faster than the gz'd binary cache.
  * Changed prot_nntp to use c_file_tcp, with the new bgets(), reducing cpu
    usage significantly (while retrieving articles: 3.0% to <0.1%)

nget (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * uses select() on reads.. no more infinate waits when disconnected

 -- Matt Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>  Wed,  7 Jun 1999 02:04:05 -0700

nget (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
