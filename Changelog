nget (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stores file read info in a seperate file, so it does not need to resave the
    cache if the only change was to mark some messages read.
  * Added +uulib version of the source distro, for easier compilation.
  * Now recognizes when there is no disk space left, and aborts.  fwrite()
    doesn't seem to report errors correctly, at least on linux glibc2.  man
    fwrite says "If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return
    value is a short item count (or zero)."  However fwrite() would _always_
    return the full item count, even if the disk was full.  I guess this is a
    libc bug. (fyi, this is on glibc 2.0.7).  It now uses write(), which does
    handle errors correctly.  
  * Added consistancy checking on header retrieval. (Steven Wilcoxon) 
  * Manpage now contains all info that it should.  
  * Fixed dupe filename checking. (broke in 0.5)
  * Only creates a host cache directory if there is something to be written in
    it.
  * Added .ngetrc, with default options, and host/group aliases.
  * Added check for -luulib in configure.in, seems some distro's have it
    installed as such, instead of -luu.

nget (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "file read" flag to stop redundant downloading.
  * Watches for a downloaded multipart file being exactly the same as what
    already exists.  Can be disabled with --disable-filecompare. (Steven Wilcoxon)
  * Rewrote header cache code, should now use as little as 1/4th the memory
    depending upon how many multipart messages there are.  Actual disk space
    saved is less due to zlib compression, but it shouldn't be near as much of
    a memory hog when running now.  If you are upgrading from a previous
    version, you will need to reget all your headers.
  * Reads .authinfo in cache dir so you don't have to put it on the command
    line.
  * Optional use of checksum in the filename, rather than
    host/group/articlenum/etc which takes up a rather large amount of space.
    Added advantage is that since the filename is now based soley on the group
    and the subject/author headers, it should be entirely possible to download
    part of a multipart file from one server and the rest from another!
  * Implemented use of crc32 checksums to compare headers when piecing together
    multipart messages, maybe save a bit of cpu power.

nget (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * a bit of fixes to the error recovery stuff.
  * handles local files with regex special chars (somewhat) better
  * nntp authinfo user/pass authorization supported
  * trying to retrieve a no longer available article will merely skip to the
    next file, rather than aborting.
  * now compiles on linux libc5

nget (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * included aclocal.m4 in the tar.gz

nget (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doesn't download files you already have.. kinda rudementary, could easily
    cause problems if you have a file like "a" in the dir..
  * c_file now has buffered gets() capability, which not only is far faster
    than gzgets(), it is even faster than the gz'd binary cache.
  * Changed prot_nntp to use c_file_tcp, with the new bgets(), reducing cpu
    usage significantly (while retrieving articles: 3.0% to <0.1%)

nget (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * uses select() on reads.. no more infinate waits when disconnected

nget (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
