nget (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doesn't download files you already have.. kinda rudementary, could easily
    cause problems if you have a file like "a" in the dir..
  * c_file now has buffered gets() capability, which not only is far faster
    than gzgets(), it is even faster than the gz'd binary cache.
  * Changed prot_nntp to use c_file_tcp, with the new bgets(), reducing cpu
    usage significantly (while retrieving articles: 3.0% to <0.1%)
