nget (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "file read" flag to stop redundant downloading.
  * Watches for a downloaded multipart file being exactly the same as what
    already exists.  Can be disabled with --disable-filecompare. (Steven Wilcoxon)
  * Rewrote header cache code, should now use as little as 1/4th the memory
    depending upon how many multipart messages there are.  Actual disk space
    saved is less due to zlib compression, but it shouldn't be near as much of
    a memory hog when running now.  If you are upgrading from a previous
    version, you will need to reget all your headers.
  * Reads .authinfo in cache dir so you don't have to put it on the command
    line.
  * Optional use of checksum in the filename, rather than
    host/group/articlenum/etc which takes up a rather large amount of space.
    Added advantage is that since the filename is now based soley on the group
    and the subject/author headers, it should be entirely possible to download
    part of a multipart file from one server and the rest from another!
  * Implemented use of crc32 checksums to compare headers when piecing together
    multipart messages, maybe save a bit of cpu power.

nget (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * a bit of fixes to the error recovery stuff.
  * handles local files with regex special chars (somewhat) better
  * nntp authinfo user/pass authorization supported
  * trying to retrieve a no longer available article will merely skip to the
    next file, rather than aborting.
  * now compiles on linux libc5

nget (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * included aclocal.m4 in the tar.gz

nget (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doesn't download files you already have.. kinda rudementary, could easily
    cause problems if you have a file like "a" in the dir..
  * c_file now has buffered gets() capability, which not only is far faster
    than gzgets(), it is even faster than the gz'd binary cache.
  * Changed prot_nntp to use c_file_tcp, with the new bgets(), reducing cpu
    usage significantly (while retrieving articles: 3.0% to <0.1%)

nget (0.2) unstable; urgency=low
